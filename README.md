[NO NAME...yet]


My project will be created using REACT360 (formally ReactVR). React 360 is about bringing interactivity into 360 spaces. Each React 360 application is made up of two pieces: React application, and the code that turns your React components into 3D elements on the screen, this is known as the "runtime".

My REACT 360 project will be a combination of virtual environments that immerse the user in a music environment, based on which type of music genre that they click on, and what bands are available for them in 3D environments. Right now, my major limiting factor will be that there are only so many videos available to the public, shot in 360 equirequtangular form. Ideally, there will also be clickable .obj files in the environment as well such as red and blue solo cups, or instruments to find out more about the band, and maybe the genre of music that they are playing. 


MVP:
1. have virtual environments for 3 different types of music
2. have 2 bands for each music genre
3. sync mp3 and mp4 files so that they are on the same timing 

Stretch:
1. Cool transitions
2. bootstrap styling if possible with REACT 360
